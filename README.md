# Bookasorous 
Bookasorous is a reading assistant for storing, looking up and using words you encounter while reading.

## Background

Bookasorous started as a "roomate" project during a grey-pandemic-winter in Seattle. My roomate and I were in several book club with our friends and we came up with this idea as a way for my roomate to have a way to solve his need (saving words he found during reading), and me to learn React Native.

The front-end is being done with me while the backend is hosted on Azure and was created by my roommate Patrick Little.

## Work In Progress
This project is a work in progress and has been put on hold for a little bit. The skelton of the app is completed and we still have remaining items to compelete on our todo list.

## TODO
(1) Implement search and add functionality 
  - Will allow functionality to search through previously added words
  - Allows functionality to add words that are not currently added in dictionary
  - Allows users to choose primary defintions to store with added words
(2) Allow words to be added to "groups"
  - These groups serve as flexible buckets where users can choose to group words by.
(3) Improve design aesthetic
  - As we prototype this project we would like to come up with a better design language
(4) Beta test prototype with friends and reading group
